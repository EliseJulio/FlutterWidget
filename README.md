# Row + Expanded Flutter Demo

A simple Flutter demo showcasing the use of the **Row** and **Expanded** widgets to create a bottom navigation bar with three tabs (`Home`, `Search`, `Profile`) and dynamic content updates.

---

## Widget Description

**Widgets:** `Row` + `Expanded`  
Thiss highlights how `Expanded` works inside a `Row` to evenly distribute space for navigation tabs in a bottom navigation bar.

---

## Three Attributes Demonstrated

1. **Row.children** – Defines the horizontal layout of the navigation items.  
2. **Expanded.child** – Makes each tab expand equally to fill available horizontal space.  
3. **Container.color** – Changes the background color of the tab; opacity is used to highlight the active tab.

During the live demo, these attributes can be shown affecting the layout and visual appearance of the tabs.
